# Chapter 6 - Content Generator

This project is the final result from Chapter 6 **Overview of the OpenAI APIs** where we build a basic site to learn how to use the OpenAI APIs. It contains two forms, one to generate text using the Chat API, and another to generate images using the Images API.

## Running the app

First install all required packages by running:

```bash
npm install
```

Then rename `.env.template` to `.env` and in the file paste in your OpenAI API key:

```conf
OPENAI_API_KEY=<paste key here>
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to view the website.
