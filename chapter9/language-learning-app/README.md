# Chapter 9 - Language Learning App

This project is the final result from Chapter 9 **Building A Language Learning App** where we build an app with quizzes for learning vocabulary, generated by ChatGPT and DALL-E. There are two types of quiz: a spelling quiz, and a translating quiz.

## Running the app

First install all required packages by running:

```bash
npm install
```

Then rename `.env.template` to `.env` and in the file paste in your OpenAI API key:

```conf
OPENAI_API_KEY=<paste key here>
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to view the website.
